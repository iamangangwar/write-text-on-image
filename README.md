# write-text-on-image
This is the script that can be used to write a text on an image. The script is used to generate certificates for students whose names and email addresses are stored in a csv file

The directory should already contain two directories named 'certificates_iiitv' and 'certificats_icd'

The data file is not shared as this repository is public. But my generated certificate is attached for reference.
